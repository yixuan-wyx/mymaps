# My Travel Map App

This personal web application allows me to track and visualize the states Iâ€™ve visited, along with highlighted memories and photos for each location. Built with Streamlit, the app features an interactive map where clicking on a state displays custom details about my experiences there.

### Features
- Interactive Map:
Display a US map with state boundaries and clickable markers or regions.

- Memories & Media:
View custom memories, photos, and details for each visited state.

- Local Data Storage:
Store all travel data locally (using JSON, CSV, or SQLite) for personal use without requiring an external database.

- Customizable Interface:
Leverage Streamlitâ€™s easy-to-use components to create a unique and flexible interface.

### ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack
- **Python**
Core programming language for app logic and data management.
- **Streamlit**
For building and deploying the web app quickly.
- **Mapping Libraries**
Use libraries like Folium (with [streamlit-folium](https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium)) or Plotly for interactive maps.

- Data Management:
Update your local database file to add or edit travel memories. The app is designed for ease of use with local file storage.

- Additional Features:
Consider integrating new features such as filtering states by visit date, or adding a photo gallery for each location.

### Future Enhancements
- Integrate a richer media display for photos and videos.
- Enhance the UI with additional Streamlit components.
